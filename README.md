# Steps Section Template

## Overview
This project is a **minimal HTML + CSS template** designed for clean, readable, and responsive text content. Originally based on a **CodeStitch steps section template**, it has been adapted for **book-style reading** while retaining the sequential “steps” layout if needed.

The template works beautifully on both desktop and mobile, with **responsive columns, optimized margins, and readable typography**.

## Features

- **Desktop Layout:** Two-column content (original steps layout), suitable for sequential content or book-style reading.  
- **Responsive Design:** Adjusts gracefully for mobile devices.  
- **Typography:** Easy-to-read fonts with proper line-height.  
- **Custom Elements:**  
  - `.first-word` for paragraph emphasis.  
- **Minimal CSS:** Lightweight, only essential styles included.  
- **Decorative Graphics:** Optional SVG and PNG graphics for visual enhancement.
